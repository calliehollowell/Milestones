      <h2>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozinak founded Apple Computer in the Job's family garage in Los Altos, California. They unveiled Apple 2 in 1977.
         This essentially created a mass market for personal computers. Apple wen public in 1981. In 1984, the Macintosh was introduced. The Macintosh wasn't
         the first computer with a "graphical user interface" that relied on icons rather than command lines. But even so, the Mac influenced the personal computing
         industry and prompted more intuitive software. Rather than typing commands and directory paths at text prompts, users moved a mouse pointer to
         visually navigate the Finder-a series of virtual folders and files, represented by icons. Later in 1998, Steve Jobs rejuvinated Apple with its first iMac.
         Its new colorful, translucent design stunned the tec industry, prompting other computer makers to move away from their standard grey box.
         It was also famous for what it didn't have: a floppy disc drive. It was a controversal move, but he was right because he decided the world would move
         to CDs and Internet Downloads and away from downloads.

      <h2>In 2001 the iPod was created. The iPod wasn't the first digital music player, but it quickly became the most popular. It became the primary driver of Apple's
        renaissance. Analysts called it a "halo" product that drew people into Apple's stores, where they somtimes bought other products too. There was also Apple's iTunes
        software offered on the iPod. It offered people an easy way to manage lots of music. This contributed to Apple's success. Apple released the software for Microsoft
        Windows in 2003. In the same year Apple launched the iTunes Store, selling songs for 99 cents apiece and creating the online music market. In the future iTunes will
        become largest music retailer  on the planet. Today, it has 435 million registered users in 119 countries and recently served up its 25 billionth song. iTunes also now
        sells much more than music: Customers can download movies, TV shows, games, books, podcasts and more.

      <h2>In 2007 Steve Jobs showed off Apple's first iPhone. He said Apple would "reinvent the phone". Jobs was correct. The device went on sell in the US on June 29. Since then,
        Apple has sold 2 billion iPhones, making it one of the largest phone makers in the world. On the new iPhone it included a digital keyboard. Most mobile device had a sort of
        a physical keyboard. It also had Motion and Orientation sensors which were used for turning the phone and it adjusting to the picture being displayed. Also another new feature
        was and App Store. This allowed for downloadable apps and games, you could only use what came on the phone no more. Along with that it came with 3d touch feature. This allowed
        for pinching and zooming an image. Overall the iPhone was a new invention that changed the world of phones. On this day they changed their brand to Apple Computer to Apple Inc.
